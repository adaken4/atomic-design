# UI Learning Project - Atomic Design and Design Systems

## Project Overview
Welcome to the 2nd quest of UI! This project explores the **Atomic Design Methodology** and the creation of design systems. Through a series of exercises, we will analyze, replicate, and design elements of UI libraries, leveraging tools like **Figma** to produce deliverables that showcase our understanding of design systems.

## Objectives
- Learn the **Atomic Design Methodology**.
- Analyze and categorize UI elements into templates, organisms, molecules, and atoms.
- Build design systems for real-world applications using **Figma**.
- Develop a consistent workflow for creating clear, simple, and effective designs.

## Project Exercises

### 1. **Snapshots of UI Elements**
#### Websites:
- Alibaba
- Booking.com
- EasyJet App
- Interrail

#### Deliverable:
- A Figma file with 4 pages:
  - **Page 1:** Template screenshot.
  - **Page 2:** Organism screenshot.
  - **Page 3:** Molecule screenshot.
  - **Page 4:** Atom screenshot.

#### Instructions:
1. Capture a template, organism, molecule, and atom from the above websites.
2. Organize the screenshots into clearly titled Figma pages.
3. Upload the Figma file to GitHub with the naming convention:
   `Name_FirstName_DeliverableName_Date_VersionNumber` (e.g., `Doe_John_UIElements_01202025_V1`).

### 2. **Material Design Layers**
#### Deliverable:
- A Figma file containing:
  - Snapshot of 3 screens of Lyft.
  - Layer ordering numbers on each screen.

#### Instructions:
1. Number the layers in order, with `1` as the background image and subsequent elements labeled sequentially.
2. Ensure clarity and readability.
3. Follow the same naming convention as above.

### 3. **EasyJet Design System**
#### Deliverable:
- A Figma file with 10 elements from the **EasyJet design system**, categorized as:
  - Atoms
  - Molecules
  - Organisms

#### Instructions:
1. Use **Avenir Book** for fonts or alternatives if unavailable.
2. Explore **Noun Project** for icons.
3. Ensure the file is visually clear and labeled appropriately.

### 4. **Climbing Group Design System**
#### Deliverables:
1. **Moodboard:**
   - Pictures.
   - Colors (2-3 main).
   - Typography.
2. **Library:**
   - At least 20 graphic elements.
   - Multistate elements (minimum 5).

#### Instructions:
- Upload all files to GitHub in a zip folder labeled:
  `ProjectTitle_Name_FirstName` (e.g., `ClimbingGroupDesign_Kennedy_John`).

### 5. **Dating App Design System**
#### Deliverables:
1. **Moodboard:**
   - Pictures.
   - Colors (2-3 main).
   - Typography.
2. **Library:**
   - At least 20 graphic elements.
   - Multistate elements (minimum 5).

#### Instructions:
- Follow a similar workflow as the Climbing Group Design System.

## Tips for Success
- **Clarity and Simplicity:** Ensure all deliverables are easy to understand.
- **Consistency:** Use uniform naming conventions and design standards.
- **Inspiration:** Draw ideas from platforms like **Dribbble**, **Noun Project**, and the **Figma community**.
- **Creativity:** Experiment with innovative designs while adhering to the principles of Atomic Design.
